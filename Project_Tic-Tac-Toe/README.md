## Overview
This project is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It follows a modular design pattern using objects and factories to handle the game logic, players, and gameboard. The project ensures minimal global code by encapsulating functionalities inside objects and modules.

- **Player Factory:** Creates player objects with names and markers (X or O).
- **Game Controller:** Manages game flow, player turns, and win conditions.
- **DOM Controller:** Updates the webpage dynamically based on game state.
- **Interactive UI:** Allows users to input names, click on the board to play, and restart the game.
- **Win Checking:** Determines wins, losses, and ties.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the game elements.
- **CSS**: Styling the game board and UI.
- **JavaScript**: Handling game logic and interactions.
